# Clothing Ontology

### Introduction
The purpose of this ontology is to create the common conceptual framework for 'talking' about clothing and/or related concepts. This should provide a common vocabulary for this domain.

In order to develope the _Ontology_ for our project we have used various external _vocabularies/ontologies/datasets_, including:
* [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/About);
* [Dublin Core Metada Initiative](http://dublincore.org/);
* [Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities](http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/) (for the moment just one term).

### Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
* the [tbox](https://github.com/danielamariei/clothing-ontology/blob/master/tbox/) folder contains the TBox of the ontology, serialized in various formats;
* the [abox](https://github.com/danielamariei/clothing-ontology/blob/master/abox/) folder contains the ABox of the ontology, serialized in various formats;
* the [queries](https://github.com/danielamariei/clothing-ontology/blob/master/queries/) folder contains various example queries that use the ontology.

### Visualizing the Ontology
The ontology can be visualized using the following tools/approaches:
* [render an interactive visualization of the Clothing Ontology using WebVOWL](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielamariei/clothing-ontology/master/tbox/clothing-ontology.ttl);
* [render a human-readable HTML page of the Clothing Ontology](http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/closure/reasoner/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielamariei/clothing-ontology/master/tbox/clothing-ontology.ttl);
* [view the Clothing Ontology in one of the various serialization formats available](https://github.com/danielamariei/clothing-ontology/blob/master/tbox/).

### Validating the Ontology
The ontology can be validated using the following tools/services:
* [validate the Clothing Ontology using the W3C RDF Validation Service](https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/rdfval?URI=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdanielamariei%2Fclothing-ontology%2Fmaster%2Ftbox%2Fclothing-ontology.rdf.xml&PARSE=Parse+URI%3A+&TRIPLES_AND_GRAPH=PRINT_BOTH&FORMAT=PNG_EMBED).
